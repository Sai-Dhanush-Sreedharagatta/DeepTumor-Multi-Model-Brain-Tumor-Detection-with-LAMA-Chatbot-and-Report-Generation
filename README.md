# NeuroScan: Brain Tumor Detection and AI-Powered Medical Chatbot

This project is an end-to-end solution for detecting brain tumors from X-ray images using advanced deep learning models like **VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet.** It also features an interactive AI-powered chatbot built with the **LAMA model** to answer medical queries related to brain tumors. After detection, the system generates a detailed diagnostic report for the user.

The project is deployed as a **web application** where users can upload brain X-ray images, receive tumor detection results, and interact with the chatbot for additional information. The integration of deep learning models and natural language processing (NLP) makes this a comprehensive tool for medical diagnostics and patient support.

## Key Features
- **Brain Tumor Detection**: Utilizes VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet models...
- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Built using the LAMA model...
- **Diagnostic Report Generation**: Generates a detailed report after detection...

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Models**: VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet, LAMA
- **Web Development**: Flask, HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## How It Works
1. **Image Upload**: Users upload a brain X-ray image...
2. **Tumor Detection**: The image is processed by the deep learning models...
3. **Chatbot Interaction**: Users can ask questions about brain tumors...
4. **Report Generation**: A detailed diagnostic report is generated...

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with more advanced models like ResNet or EfficientNet...
- Support for multi-language chatbot interactions...
